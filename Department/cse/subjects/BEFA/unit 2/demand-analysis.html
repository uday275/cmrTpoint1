                <c1 class="c1">Demand Analysis</c1>

                <P>In common parlance, demand means the desire for an object. But in economics demand is something more
                    than this. According to Stonier and Hague, "Demand in economics means demand backed up by enough
                    money to pay for the goods demanded". This means that the demand becomes effective only if it is
                    backed by the purchasing power. In addition to this, there must be willingness to buy a commodity.
                </P>

                <P>Thus demand in economics means the desire backed by the willingness to buy a commodity and the
                    purchasing power to pay.</P>

                <P>In the words of Benham, "The demand for anything at a given price is the amount of it which will be
                    bought per unit of time at that price".</P>

                <P>Hence, demand refers to the amount of commodity which an individual consumer is willing to purchase
                    at a given price in a given period. The demand is said to exist when the following three conditions
                    are fulfilled:</P>

                <P><strong>1. Desire to purchase</strong></P>

                <P><strong>2. Ability to pay</strong></P>

                <P><strong>3. Willingness to pay</strong></P>

                <P>Ex: A beggar may have desire to purchase a car but he cannot pay money for it.</P>

                <P>Ex: A miser does not purchase a car but he can pay money for it.</P>
                <c1 class="c1">Demand Function</c1>



                <P>Demand function is a function which describes a relationship between one variable and its
                    determinants. The demand function for a good relates the quantity of good which consumers demand
                    during a given period to the factors which influence the demand. Quantity demanded is the dependent
                    variable and all the factors are independent variables. The factors can be built up into a demand
                    function. The demand function can be mathematically expressed as follows:</P>

                <P><strong>Q = f(P, I, T, P<sub>1</sub>..P<sub>n</sub>, EP, EI, A, O)</strong></P>

                <P>Q = Quantity demanded <br>
                    f = Function of <br>
                    P = Price of goods itself <br>
                    I = Income of consumers <br>
                    T = Taste and preferences <br>
                    P<sub>1</sub>..P<sub>n</sub> = Price of related goods <br>
                    EP = Expectation about future price <br>
                    EI = Expectation about future income <br>
                    A = Advertisement <br>
                    O = Other factors</P>
                <c1 class="c1">Determinants Of Demand</c1>
                <P>There are several factors or determinants that affect the individual demand and market demand for a
                    product. These factors are economic, social as well as political factors. The effect of all the
                    factors on the amount demanded for the commodity is called Demand Function. These factors are as
                    follows:</P>

                <P><strong>1. Price of the Commodity:</strong><br>
                    The most important factor affecting amount demanded is the price of the commodity. The amount of a
                    commodity demanded at a particular price is more properly called price demand. The relation between
                    price and demand is called the Law of Demand. The demand for a commodity varies inversely with its
                    price. A decrease in price increases the purchasing power of consumers and an increase in the price
                    decreases the purchasing power of the consumers.</P>

                    </picture>
                </figure>

                <P><strong>2. Income of the Consumer:</strong><br>
                    The second most important factor influencing demand is consumer income. Individual consumer’s income
                    determines his purchasing ability. When other things remaining constant, if income increases, demand
                    increases and vice-versa. An increase in income makes an individual to buy many commodities. The
                    effect of income on demand can be analysed for normal goods, perishable goods and inferior goods.
                </P>

                <P><strong>a) Normal goods:</strong> Usually, the demand for a normal good goes in the same direction
                    with consumer’s income i.e., demand for normal goods is directly related to consumer’s income.</P>

                    </picture>
                </figure>

                <P><strong>b) Perishable goods:</strong> For perishable goods like foods, fruits, meat, vegetables,
                    milk, etc., whose life is very short, the quantity demanded raises with an increase in income, but
                    after a certain level it remains constant even though the income raises.</P>

                    </picture>
                </figure>

                <P><strong>c) Inferior goods:</strong> The goods for which the demand decreases even though the income
                    level increases are inferior goods or cheap goods or ordinary goods.</P>
                <figure class="image">
                    <picture>

                        <a href="#"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/pyzQ4hP/d4.png" alt="d4" border="0"

                    </picture>
                </figure>

                <P><strong>3. Prices of related goods:</strong><br>
                    In a given market, if the price of one good influences the quantity demanded of another good, these
                    two goods are said to be related goods. Two commodities in a given market are related to each other
                    either as Substitutes or Complementary goods.</P>

                <P><strong>a. Substitutes:</strong> When a want can be satisfied by alternative similar goods, they are
                    said to be substitutes to each other. Ex: Tea and Coffee, Santhoor soap and Lux soap, etc. The below
                    graph indicates that as the price of coffee increases, the demand for tea increases. There is a
                    direct relation between the price of coffee and the demand for tea.</P>
                <figure class="image">
                    <picture>

                        <a href="#"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/SJ704LP/d5.png" alt="d5" border="0"
                                sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a>
                    </picture>
                </figure>

                <P><strong>b. Complementary goods:</strong> When a want can be satisfied by two or more goods in a
                    combination, these goods are termed as complementary goods. In other words, if the price of one good
                    increases, the demand for another good will decrease. Ex: Bread and Butter, Pen and Ink, Car and
                    Petrol, Sugar and Tea, and Shoe and Socks, etc. The below table and graph indicate the indirect
                    relationship between the price of one good and the demand for another good.</P>
                <figure class="image">
                    <picture>

                        <border= href="#"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/Hp0Byx1/d6.png" alt="d6" border="0"
                                sizes="(max-width: 660px) 100vw, 660px"></a>
                    </picture>
                </figure>


                <P><strong>4. Tastes and habits of the Consumers:</strong><br>
                    Irrespective of the price of a good and income levels of consumers, demand for many goods depends on
                    consumers’ tastes and habits. For example, the demand for ice-creams, chocolates, alcohol, tea,
                    cigarettes, etc. depends on individual tastes and habits. In cases like these, a strict vegetarian
                    does not demand meat at any price, whereas a non-vegetarian will buy meat at any price.</P>

                <P><strong>5. Wealth:</strong><br>
                    The amount demanded of a commodity is also affected by the amount of wealth as well as its
                    distribution. The wealthier the people are, the higher is the demand for normal commodities. If
                    wealth is more equally distributed, the demand for necessaries and comforts is more. On the other
                    hand, if some people are rich while the majority are poor, the demand for luxuries is generally
                    higher.</P>

                <P><strong>6. Population:</strong><br>
                    Increase in population increases demand for the necessaries of life. The composition of the
                    population also affects demand. Composition of population means the proportion of young and old and
                    children as well as the ratio of men to women. A change in the composition of population has an
                    effect on the nature of demand for different commodities.</P>

                <P><strong>7. Government Policy:</strong><br>
                    Government policy affects the demands for commodities through taxation. Taxing a commodity increases
                    its price and the demand goes down. Similarly, financial help from the government increases the
                    demand for a commodity while lowering its price.</P>

                <P><strong>8. Expectations regarding future prices and incomes:</strong><br>
                    If consumers expect changes in the price of a commodity in the future, they will change the demand
                    at present even when the present price remains the same. Similarly, if consumers expect their
                    incomes to rise in the near future, they may increase the demand for a commodity just now.</P>

                <P><strong>9. Climate and weather:</strong><br>
                    The climate of an area and the weather prevailing there has a decisive effect on consumers’ demand.
                    In cold areas, woolen cloth is demanded. During hot summer days, ice is very much in demand. On a
                    rainy day, ice cream is not so much demanded.</P>

                <P><strong>10. State of business:</strong><br>
                    The level of demand for different commodities also depends upon the business conditions in the
                    country. If the country is passing through boom conditions, there will be a marked increase in
                    demand. On the other hand, the level of demand goes down during a depression.</P>
