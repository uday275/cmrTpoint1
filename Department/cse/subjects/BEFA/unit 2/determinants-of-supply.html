                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Number of Sellers</strong>
                        <p>Greater the number of sellers, greater will be the quantity of a product or service supplied
                            in a market and vice versa. Thus increase in number of sellers will increase supply and
                            shift the supply curve rightwards whereas decrease in number of sellers will decrease the
                            supply and shift the supply curve leftwards. For example, when more firms enter an industry,
                            the number of sellers increases thus increasing the supply.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prices of Resources</strong>
                        <p>Increase in resource prices increases the production costs thus shrinking profits and vice
                            versa. Since profit is a major incentive for producers to supply goods and services,
                            increase in profits increases the supply and decrease in profits reduces the supply. In
                            other words supply is indirectly proportional to resource prices. Increase in resource
                            prices reduces the supply and the supply curve is shifted leftwards whereas decrease in
                            resource prices increases the supply and the supply curve is shifted rightwards.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Taxes and Subsidies</strong>
                        <p>Taxes reduces profits, therefore increase in taxes reduce supply whereas decrease in taxes
                            increase supply. Subsidies reduce the burden of production costs on suppliers, thus
                            increasing the profits. Therefore increase in subsidies increase supply and decrease in
                            subsidies decrease supply.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Technology</strong>
                        <p>Improvement in technology enables more efficient production of goods and services. Thus
                            reducing the production costs and increasing the profits. As a result supply is increased
                            and supply curve is shifted rightwards. Since technology in general rarely deteriorates,
                            therefore it is needless to say that deterioration of technology reduces supply.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Suppliers' Expectations</strong>
                        <p>Change in expectations of suppliers about future price of a product or service may affect
                            their current supply. However, unlike other determinants of supply, the effect of suppliers'
                            expectations on supply is difficult to generalize. For example when farmers suspect the
                            future price of a crop to increase, they will withhold their agricultural produce to benefit
                            from higher price thus reducing the supply. In case of manufacturers, when they expect the
                            future price to increase, they will employ more resources to increase their output and this
                            may increase current supply as well.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prices of Related Products</strong>
                        <p>Firms which are able to manufacture related products (such as air conditioners and
                            refrigerators) will the shift their production to a product the price of which increases
                            substantially related to other related product(s) thus causing a reduction of supply of the
                            products which were produced before. For example a firm which produces cricket bats is
                            usually able to manufacture hockey sticks as well. When the price of hockey sticks
                            increases, the firm will produce more hockey sticks and less cricket bats. As a result, the
                            supply of cricket bats will be reduced.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Prices of Joint Products</strong>
                        <p>When two or more goods are produced in a joint process and the price of any of the product
                            increases, the supply of all the joint products will be increased and vice versa. For
                            example, increase in price of meat will increase the supply of leather.</p>
                    </li>
