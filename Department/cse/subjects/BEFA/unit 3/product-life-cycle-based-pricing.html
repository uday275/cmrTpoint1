                <p>Companies must adapt to the stages of the product life cycle to effectively sell and promote their
                    products. Depending on the product life cycle stage, a company will develop branding techniques and
                    an appropriate pricing model. Understanding each stage helps businesses increase profits.</p>

                <p>The stages of a product life cycle govern how a product is priced, distributed, and promoted. A new
                    product goes through multiple stages during the course of its life cycle, including an introduction
                    stage, growth stage, maturity stage, and decline stage. As a product ages, companies look for new
                    ways to brand it, and also explore pricing changes. Market and competitor research help businesses
                    assess the proper course of action to maintain product profitability.</p>

                <div class="c1">Introduction Stage</div>

                <p>A new product may simply be either another brand name added to the existing ones or an altogether new
                    product. Pricing a new brand for which there are many substitutes available in the market is not a
                    big problem as pricing a new product for which close substitutes are not available.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Skimming Price Policy:</strong> Selling a product at a high price, sacrificing high sales
                    to gain a high profit, therefore ‘skimming’ the market. Usually employed to reimburse the cost of
                    investment of the original research into the product - commonly used in electronic markets when a
                    new range, such as DVD players, are firstly dispatched into the market at a high price.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Penetration Price Policy:</strong> This pricing policy is adopted generally in the case of
                    a new product for which substitutes are available. This policy requires fixing a lower initial price
                    designed to penetrate the market as quickly as possible.</p>

                <div class="c1">Growth Stage</div>

                <p>During the growth stage, a company aims to develop brand recognition and increase their customer
                    base. The quality of their product is often improved based on early reviews, and technical support
                    is usually enhanced. Pricing remains generally stable as demand continues with minimal competition.
                    A larger distribution network is formed to keep up with the pace of demand.</p>

                <div class="c1">Maturity Stage</div>

                <p>In the maturity stage, the steady sales start to decline and companies face greater challenges in the
                    marketplace. Competitors will often introduce rival products with the intent of grabbing some of the
                    market share. This is the product life cycle stage in which the customer base is heavily fought over
                    and price decreases most often occur. Additional features are added to distinguish a product from
                    its competitors. Companies run promotions during this stage that highlight the primary differences
                    between their product and their competitors' products.</p>

                <div class="c1">Decline Stage</div>

                <p>In the decline stage, a company will make important decisions regarding the future of their product.
                    They can choose to create new iterations of the product with new features, or they can reduce the
                    price and offer it at a discount. A company may choose to discontinue the product altogether, either
                    disposing of their inventory or selling it to another company who is willing to manufacture and
                    market it. Promotion at this stage will depend on whether a company chooses to continue its product
                    and how they plan to re-market it.</p>
