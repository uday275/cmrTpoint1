                    <c1 class="c1">I. Sole Proprietorship</c1>
                </p>
                <p>The <strong>sole trader</strong> is the simplest, oldest and natural form of business organization.
                    It is also called <strong>sole proprietorship</strong>. <strong>'Sole'</strong> means one.
                    <strong>'Sole trader'</strong> implies that there is only one trader who is the owner of the
                    business.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <c1 class="c1">Features</c1>
                </p>
                <p>• It is <strong>easy to start a business</strong> under this form and also <strong>easy to
                        close</strong>.</p>
                <p>• He introduces his own capital. Sometimes, he may borrow, if necessary.</p>
                <p>• He enjoys <strong>all the profits</strong> and in case of loss, he alone suffers.</p>
                <p>• He has <strong>unlimited liability</strong> which implies that his liability extends to his
                    personal properties in case of loss.</p>
                <p>• He has a <strong>high degree of flexibility</strong> to shift from one business to the other.</p>
                <p>• <strong>Business secrets</strong> can be guarded well.</p>
                <p>• There is <strong>no continuity</strong>. The business comes to a close with the death, illness or
                    insanity of the sole trader. Unless, the legal heirs show interest to continue the business, the
                    business cannot be restored.</p>
                <p>• He has <strong>total operational freedom</strong>. He is the owner, manager and controller.</p>
                <p>• He can be <strong>directly in touch with the customers</strong>.</p>
                <p>• He can <strong>take decisions very fast</strong> and <strong>implement them promptly</strong>.</p>
                <p>• Rates of tax, for example, income tax and so on are comparatively very low.</p>

                <p>
                    <c1 class="c1">Advantages</c1>
                </p>
                <p>1. <strong>Easy to start and easy to close</strong>: Formation of a sole trader form of organization
                    is relatively easy even closing the business is easy.</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Personal contact with customers directly</strong>: Based on the tastes and preferences of
                    the customers the stocks can be maintained.</p>
                <p>3. <strong>Prompt decision-making</strong>: To improve the quality of services to the customers, he
                    can take any decision and implement the same promptly. He is the boss and he is responsible for his
                    business Decisions relating to growth or expansion can be made promptly.</p>
                <p>4. <strong>High degree of flexibility</strong>: Based on the profitability, the trader can decide to
                    continue or change the business, if need be.</p>
                <p>5. <strong>Secrecy</strong>: Business secrets can well be maintained because there is only one
                    trader.</p>
                <p>6. <strong>Low rate of taxation</strong>: The rate of income tax for sole traders is relatively very
                    low.</p>
                <p>7. <strong>Direct motivation</strong>: If there are profits, all the profits belong to the trader
                    himself. In other words. If he works more hard, he will get more profits. This is the direct
                    motivating factor. At the same time, if he does not take active interest, he may stand to lose badly
                    also.</p>
                <p>8. <strong>Total Control</strong>: The ownership, management and control are in the hands of the sole
                    trader and hence it is easy to maintain the hold on business.</p>
                <p>9. <strong>Minimum interference from government</strong>: Except in matters relating to public
                    interest, government does not interfere in the business matters of the sole trader. The sole trader
                    is free to fix price for his products/services if he enjoys monopoly market.</p>
                <p>10. <strong>Transferability</strong>: The legal heirs of the sole trader may take the possession of
                    the business.</p>
                <p>
                    <c1 class="c1">Disadvantages</c1>
                </p>

                <p>1. <strong>Unlimited liability</strong>: The liability of the sole trader is unlimited. It means that
                    the sole trader has to bring his personal property to clear off the loans of his business. From the
                    legal point of view, he is not different from his business.</p>
                <p>2. <strong>Limited amounts of capital</strong>: The resources a sole trader can mobilize cannot be
                    very large and hence this naturally sets a limit for the scale of operations.</p>
                <p>3. <strong>No division of labour</strong>: All the work related to different functions such as
                    marketing, production, finance, labour and so on has to be taken care of by the sole trader himself.
                    There is nobody else to take his burden. Family members and relatives cannot show as much interest
                    as the trader takes.</p>
                <p>4. <strong>Uncertainty</strong>: There is no continuity in the duration of the business. On the
                    death, insanity of insolvency the business may be come to an end.</p>
                <p>5. <strong>Inadequate for growth and expansion</strong>: This form is suitable for only small size,
                    one-man-show type of organizations. This may not really work out for growing and expanding
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>6. <strong>Lack of specialization</strong>: The services of specialists such as accountants, market
                    researchers, consultants and so on, are not within the reach of most of the sole traders.</p>
                <p>7. <strong>More competition</strong>: Because it is easy to set up a small business, there is a high
                    degree of competition among the small businessmen and a few who are good in taking care of customer
                    requirements along can service.</p>
                <p>8. <strong>Low bargaining power</strong>: The sole trader is in the receiving end in terms of loans
                    or supply of raw materials. He may have to compromise many times regarding the terms and conditions
                    of purchase of materials or borrowing loans from the finance houses or banks.</p>
                <p>
                    <c1 class="c1">II. Partnership</c1>
                </p>

                <p>Partnership is an improved from of sole trader in certain respects. Where there are like-minded
                    persons with resources, they can come together to do the business and share the profits/losses of
                    the business in an agreed ratio. Persons who have entered into such an agreement are individually
                    called ‗partners‘ and collectively called ‗firm‘. The relationship among partners is called a
                    partnership.</p>

                <p>Indian Partnership Act, 1932 defines partnership as the relationship between two or more persons who
                    agree to share the profits of the business carried on by all or any one of them acting for all.</p>

                <p>
                    <c1 class="c1">Features</c1>
                </p>
                <p><strong>Relationship:</strong> Partnership is a relationship among persons. It is relationship
                    resulting out of an agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>There should be a business:</strong> Business should be conducted.</p>
                <p><strong>Agreement:</strong> Persons should agree to share the profits/losses of the business</p>
                <p><strong>Carried on by all or any one of them acting for all:</strong> The business can be carried on
                    by all or any one of the persons acting for all. This means that the business can be carried on by
                    one person who is the agent for all other persons. Every partner is both an agent and a principal.
                </p>
                <p><strong>Unlimited liability:</strong> The liability of the partners is unlimited. The partnership and
                    partners, in the eye of law, and not different but one and the same. Hence, the partners have to

                <p><strong>Number of partners:</strong> According to the Indian Partnership Act, the minimum number of
                    partners should be two and the maximum number if restricted, as given below:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>10 partners is case of banking business</li>
                    <li>20 in case of non-banking business</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Division of labour:</strong> Because there are more than two persons, the work can be divided
                    among the partners based on their aptitude.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal contact with customers:</strong> The partners can continuously be in touch with the
                    customers to monitor their requirements.</p>
                <p><strong>Flexibility:</strong> All the partners are likeminded persons and hence they can take any
                    decision relating to business.</p>
                <c1 class="c1">Partnership Deed</c1>
                <p>The written agreement among the partners is called ‘the partnership deed’. It contains the terms and
                    conditions governing the working of partnership. The following are contents of the partnership deed:

                    <c1 class="c1">Kind Of Partners:</c1>
                </p>
                <p><strong>1. Active Partner:</strong> Active partner takes active part in the affairs of the
                    partnership. He is also called a working partner.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Sleeping Partner:</strong> Sleeping partner contributes to capital but does not take part
                    in the affairs of the partnership.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Nominal Partner:</strong> Nominal partner is a partner just for namesake. He neither
                    contributes to capital nor takes part in the affairs of business. Normally, the nominal partners are
                    those who have good business connections and are well placed in society.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Partner by Estoppels:</strong> Estoppels means behavior or conduct. Partner by estoppels
                    gives an impression to outsiders that he is the partner in the firm. In fact, he neither contributes
                    to capital nor takes any role in the affairs of the partnership.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Partner by holding out:</strong> If partners declare a particular person (having social
                    status) as a partner and this person does not contradict even after he comes to know such
                    declaration, he is called a partner by holding out and he is liable for the claims of third parties.
                    However, the third parties should prove they entered into a contract with the firm in the belief
                    that he is the partner of the firm. Such a person is called a partner by holding out.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Minor Partner:</strong> A minor has a special status in the partnership. A minor can be
                    admitted for the benefits of the firm. A minor is entitled to his share of profits of the firm. The
                    liability of a minor partner is limited to the extent of his contribution of the capital of the
                    firm.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Easy to form:</strong> Once there is a group of like-minded persons and good business
                    proposal, it is easy to start and register a partnership.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Availability of larger amount of capital:</strong> More amount of capital can be raised
                    from more number of partners.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Division of labour:</strong> The different partners come with varied backgrounds and
                    skills. This facilitates division of labour.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Flexibility:</strong> The partners are free to change their decisions, add or drop a
                    particular product or start a new business or close the present one and so on.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Personal contact with customers:</strong> There is scope to keep close monitoring with
                    customers requirements by keeping one of the partners in charge of sales and marketing. Necessary
                    changes can be initiated based on the merits of the proposals from the customers.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Quick decisions and prompt action:</strong> If there is consensus among partners, it is
                    enough to implement any decision and initiate prompt action. Sometimes, it may more time for the
                    partners on strategic issues to reach consensus.</p>
                <p><strong>7. The positive impact of unlimited liability:</strong> Every partner is always alert about
                    his impending danger of unlimited liability. Hence he tries to do his best to bring profits for the
                    partnership firm by making good use of all his contacts.</p>

                <p class="c1">Disadvantages:</p>

                <p><strong>1. Formation of partnership is difficult:</strong> Only like-minded persons can start a
                    partnership. It is sarcastically said, ‘it is easy to find a life partner, but not a business
                    partner‘.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Liability:</strong> The partners have joint and several liabilities beside unlimited
                    liability. Joint and several liability puts additional burden on the partners, which means that even
                    the personal properties of the partner or partners can be attached. Even when all but one partner
                    become insolvent, the solvent partner has to bear the entire burden of business loss.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Lack of harmony or cohesiveness:</strong> It is likely that partners may not, most often
                    work as a group with cohesiveness. This result in mutual conflicts. Lack of harmony results in delay
                    in decisions and paralyses the entire operations.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Limited growth:</strong> The resources when compared to sole trader, a partnership may
                    raise little more. But when compare to the other forms such as a company, resources raised in this
                    form of organization are limited. Added to this, there is a restriction on the maximum number of
                    partners.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Instability:</strong> The partnership form is known for its instability. The firm may be
                    dissolved on death, insolvency or insanity of any of the partners.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Lack of Public confidence:</strong> Public and even the financial institutions look at the
                    unregistered firm with a suspicious eye. Though registration of the firm under the Indian
                    Partnership Act is a solution of such problem, this cannot revive public confidence into this form
                    of organization overnight. The partnership can create confidence in other only with their
                    performance.</p>
                <p class="c1">III. Joint Stock Company</p>

                <p class="c1">Company Defined</p>
                <p>Lord justice Lindley explained the concept of the joint stock company from of organization as
                    „an association of many persons who contribute money or money‟s worth to a common stock and
                    employ it for a common purpose‟.</p>

                <p class="c1">Features</p>
                <p><strong>1. Artificial person:</strong> The Company has no form or shape. It is an artificial person
                    created by law. It is intangible, invisible and existing only, in the eyes of law.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Separate legal existence:</strong> it has an independence existence, it separate from its
                    members. It can acquire the assets. It can borrow for the company. It can sue other if they are in
                    default in payment of dues, breach of contract with it, if any. Similarly, outsiders for any claim
                    can sue it.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Voluntary association of persons:</strong> The Company is an association of voluntary
                    association of persons who want to carry on business for profit. To carry on business, they need
                    capital. So they invest in the share capital of the company.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Limited Liability:</strong> The shareholders have limited liability i.e., liability
                    limited to the face value of the shares held by him.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Capital is divided into shares:</strong> The total capital is divided into a certain
                    number of units. Each unit is called a share.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Transferability of shares:</strong> In the company form of organization, the shares can be
                    transferred from one person to the other. A shareholder of a public company can sell his holding of
                    shares at his will. However, the shares of a private company cannot be transferred.</p>
                <p><strong>7. Common Seal:</strong> As the company is an artificial person created by law has no
                    physical form, it cannot sign its name on a paper; so, it has a common seal on which its name is
                    engraved. The common seal should affix every document or contract.</p>
                <p><strong>8. Perpetual succession:</strong> ‛Members may comes and members may go, but the company
                    continues for ever.</p>
                <p><strong>9. Ownership and Management separated:</strong> The shareholders are spread over the length
                    and breadth of the country, and sometimes, they are from different parts of the world. To facilitate
                    administration, the shareholders elect some among themselves directors to a Board, which looks after
                    the management of the business. The Board recruits the managers and employees at different levels in
                    the management. Thus the management is separated from the owners.</p>
                <p><strong>10. Winding up:</strong> Winding up refers to the putting an end to the company. Because law
                    creates it, only law can put an end to it. The company is not affected by the death or insolvency of
                    any of its members.</p>
                <p><strong>11. The name of the company ends with „limited‟:</strong> it is necessary that the name of
                    the company ends with limited (Ltd.) to give an indication to the outsiders that they are dealing
                    with the company with limited liability and they should be careful about the liability aspect of
                    their transactions with the company.</p>
                <p class="c1">Advantages</p>

                <p><strong>1. Mobilization of larger resources:</strong> A joint stock company provides opportunity for
                    the investors to invest, even small sums, in the capital of large companies. The facilities rising
                    of larger resources.</p>
                <p><strong>2. Separate legal entity:</strong> The Company has separate legal entity. It is registered
                    under Indian Companies Act, 1956.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Limited liability:</strong> The shareholder has limited liability in respect of the shares
                    held by him. In no case, does his liability exceed more than the face value of the shares allotted
                    to him.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Transferability of shares:</strong> The shares can be transferred to others. However, the
                    private company shares cannot be transferred.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Liquidity of investments:</strong> By providing the transferability of shares, shares can
                    be converted into cash.</p>
                <p><strong>6. Inculcates the habit of savings and investments:</strong> Because the share face value is
                    very low, this promotes the habit of saving among the common man and mobilizes the same towards
                    investments in the company.</p>
                <p><strong>7. Democracy in management:</strong> the shareholders elect the directors in a democratic way
                    in the general body meetings.</p>
                <p><strong>8. Continued existence:</strong> The Company has perpetual succession. It has no natural end.
                    It continues forever and ever unless law put an end to it.</p>
                <p><strong>9. Growth and Expansion:</strong> With large resources and professional management, the
                    company can earn good returns on its operations, build good amount of reserves and further consider
                    the proposals for growth and expansion.</p>

                <p class="c1">Disadvantages</p>

                <p><strong>1. Formation of company is a long drawn procedure:</strong> Promoting a joint stock company
                    involves a long drawn procedure. It is expensive and involves large number of legal formalities.</p>
                <p><strong>2. High degree of government interference:</strong> The government brings out a number of
                    rules and regulations governing the internal conduct of the operations of a company such as
                    meetings, voting, audit and so on, and any violation of these rules results into statutory lapses,
                    punishable under the companies act.</p>
                <p><strong>3. Inordinate delays in decision-making:</strong> As the size of the organization grows, the
                    number of levels in organization also increases in the name of specialization. The more the number
                    of levels, the more is the delay in decision-making.</p>
                <p><strong>4. Lack or initiative:</strong> In most of the cases, the employees of the company at
                    different levels show slack in their personal initiative with the result, the opportunities once
                    missed do not recur and the company loses the revenue.</p>
                <p><strong>5. Lack of responsibility and commitment:</strong> In some cases, the managers at different
                    levels are afraid to take risk and more worried about their jobs rather than the huge funds invested
                    in the capital of the company lose the revenue.</p>
                <p class="c1">IV. Limited Liability Company (LLC)</p>

                <p>Limited Liability Company is another category of company registered under the Indian New Companies
                    Act, 2013. There are number of companies available in India including private limited and public
                    limited ones but Limited Liability Company is a brand new one in the line. It's often called as a
                    Limited Liability Corporation and its nature of business is quite similar with partnership firm and
                    sole trade business. Company is an association of persons or an artificial person formed under the
                    Indian Companies act in order to carry out a certain business. Under the Limited Liability Company
                    Act, liability is limited among members or partners.</p>

                <p>New Companies Act, 2013 has defined all rules and regulations regarding incorporating and registering
                    all limited liability companies. One should apply to the Registrar of Companies (ROC) by giving all
                    the details regarding company including name of the company, name and address of board of directors,
                    location of the company as per the company registration services.</p>

                <p>A private company whose owners are legally responsible for its debts only to the extent of the amount
                    of capital they invested. A Limited Liability Company, also known as an LLC, is a type of business
                    structure that combines traits of both a sole-proprietorship and a company. An LLC is eligible for
                    the pass-through taxation feature of a partnership or sole proprietorship, while at the same time
                    limiting the liability of the owners, similar to a company. As the LLC is not considered a separate
                    entity, the company does not pay taxes or take on losses. Instead, this is done by the owners as
                    they have to report the business profits, or losses, on their personal income tax returns. However,
                    just like company, members of an LLC are protected from personal liabilities, thus the name Limited
                    Liability.</p>

                <p>A limited liability company is an U.S. form of privately owned company that combines the limited
                    liability of a company with the simplified taxation of a sole proprietorship or partnership. Owners
                    of a limited liability company, referred to as an ―LLC,‖ report the company‘s profits and losses on
                    their personal income tax returns, rather than preparing separate corporate tax returns. This is
                    known as ―pass-through taxation.‖ LLC owners are referred to as ―members,‖ and the company may be
                    owned by a single individual, two or more individuals, or by a company or another LLC.</p>
                <p class="c1">Features</p>

                <p><strong>1. Limited liability:</strong> As the name implies, members‘ liabilities for the debts and
                    obligations of the LLC are limited to their own investment.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Pass-through taxation:</strong> For taxation purposes, income from your business can be
                    treated as your own personal income, and is therefore not subject to certain corporate taxes for
                    which companies are liable.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Separate Legal Entity:</strong> A LLP is a legal entity and a juristic person established
                    under the Act. Therefore, a LLP has wide legal capacity and can own property and also incur debts.
                    However, the Partners of a LLP have no liability to the creditors of a LLP for the debts of the LLP.
                </p>

                <p><strong>4. Uninterrupted Existence:</strong> A LLP has 'perpetual succession', that is continued or
                    uninterrupted existence until it is legally dissolved. A LLP being a separate legal person, is
                    unaffected by the death or other departure of any Partner. Hence, a LLP continues to be in existence
                    irrespective of the changes in ownership.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Audit not Required:</strong> A LLP does not require audit if it has less than Rs. 40 lakhs
                    of turnover and less than Rs.25 lakhs of capital contribution. Therefore, LLPs are ideal for
                    startups and small businesses that are just starting their operations and want to have minimal
                    regulatory compliance related formalities.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Easy Transferability:</strong> The ownership of a LLP can be easily transferred to another
                    person by inducting them as a Partner of the LLP. LLP is a separate legal entity separate from its
                    Partners, so by changing the Partners, the ownership of the LLP can be changed.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Owning Property:</strong> A LLP being an artificial judicial person, can acquire, own,
                    enjoy and sell, property in its name. No Partner can make any claim upon the property of the LLP -
                    so long as the LLP is a going concern.</p>
                <p class="c1">Advantages</p>

                <p><strong>1. Limited liability:</strong> As the name implies, members‘ liabilities for the debts and
                    obligations of the LLC are limited to their own investment.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Pass-through taxation:</strong> For taxation purposes, income from your business can be
                    treated as your own personal income, and is therefore not subject to certain corporate taxes for
                    which companies are liable.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Limitless ownership:</strong> Some legal structures limit the number of people allowed to
                    file as owners. With an LLC, there is no limit to the number of owners. An LLC can have one member
                    or hundreds of members.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Allocation flexibility:</strong> In an LLC, the amount of money that owners invest into
                    the business doesn‘t need to equal their percentage of ownership. When an LLC is formed, members
                    create an operating agreement, in which different percentages of company profits and losses can be
                    assigned to owners regardless of the amounts of their initial investments.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Freedom in management:</strong> Unlike standard companies, LLCs are not required to have a
                    board of directors, annual meetings, or strict book requirements. This can free up a lot of time and
                    stress to let you run your business on your own terms. As you can imagine, this can be an important
                    advantage of a limited liability company as well.</p>
                <p class="c1">Disadvantages</p>

                <p><strong>1. Building capital:</strong> Unlike companies, which can issue stock in order to increase
                    funds for their companies, LLCs have to work a little harder to find investors and sources of
                    capital due to the greater legal obligations to add a new member to an LLC. If you have a fast
                    growth internet company that needs venture capital to scale, this limitation is one of the major
                    disadvantages of a limited liability company.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Higher fees:</strong> LLCs must typically pay more fees to file as LLCs compared to some
                    other business entities or sole proprietorships.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Government regulation:</strong> Because of the protections afforded to LLCs, some types of
                    businesses are ineligible to file as LLCs. Banks, insurance companies, and medical service companies
                    are examples of businesses that may be barred from filing.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Lack of case law:</strong> The LLC business form is a relatively new concept. As a result,
                    not a lot of cases have been decided surrounding LLCs. Case law is important because of
                    predictability. If you know a court has ruled a certain way, you can act accordingly to protect
                    yourself.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Confusion About Roles:</strong> Whereas corporations have specific roles (like directors,
                    managers, and employees), LLCs generally do not. This can make it difficult for the company and
                    especially investors to know who‘s in charge, who can sign certain contracts, etc. Some of this
                    confusion can be avoided by creating an LLC Operating Agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Limited Life:</strong> In many jurisdictions, if a member departs the LLC, the LLC ceases
                    to exist. This is unlike a corporation whose identity is unaffected by the comings and goings of
                    shareholders. Members of LLCs can combat this weakness in the Operating Agreement.</p>
