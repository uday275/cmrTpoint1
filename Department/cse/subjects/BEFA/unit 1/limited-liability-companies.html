                <p class="c1"> Limited Liability Company (LLC)</p>

                <p>Limited Liability Company is another category of company registered under the Indian New
                    Companies
                    Act, 2013. There are number of companies available in India including private limited and public
                    limited ones but Limited Liability Company is a brand new one in the line. It's often called as
                    a
                    Limited Liability Corporation and its nature of business is quite similar with partnership firm
                    and
                    sole trade business. Company is an association of persons or an artificial person formed under
                    the
                    Indian Companies act in order to carry out a certain business. Under the Limited Liability
                    Company
                    Act, liability is limited among members or partners.</p>

                <p>New Companies Act, 2013 has defined all rules and regulations regarding incorporating and
                    registering
                    all limited liability companies. One should apply to the Registrar of Companies (ROC) by giving
                    all
                    the details regarding company including name of the company, name and address of board of
                    directors,
                    location of the company as per the company registration services.</p>

                <p>A private company whose owners are legally responsible for its debts only to the extent of the
                    amount
                    of capital they invested. A Limited Liability Company, also known as an LLC, is a type of
                    business
                    structure that combines traits of both a sole-proprietorship and a company. An LLC is eligible
                    for
                    the pass-through taxation feature of a partnership or sole proprietorship, while at the same
                    time
                    limiting the liability of the owners, similar to a company. As the LLC is not considered a
                    separate
                    entity, the company does not pay taxes or take on losses. Instead, this is done by the owners as
                    they have to report the business profits, or losses, on their personal income tax returns.
                    However,
                    just like company, members of an LLC are protected from personal liabilities, thus the name
                    Limited
                    Liability.</p>

                <p>A limited liability company is an U.S. form of privately owned company that combines the limited
                    liability of a company with the simplified taxation of a sole proprietorship or partnership.
                    Owners
                    of a limited liability company, referred to as an ―LLC,‖ report the company‘s profits and losses
                    on
                    their personal income tax returns, rather than preparing separate corporate tax returns. This is
                    known as ―pass-through taxation.‖ LLC owners are referred to as ―members,‖ and the company may
                    be
                    owned by a single individual, two or more individuals, or by a company or another LLC.</p>
                <p class="c1">Features</p>

                <p><strong>1. Limited liability:</strong> As the name implies, members‘ liabilities for the debts
                    and
                    obligations of the LLC are limited to their own investment.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Pass-through taxation:</strong> For taxation purposes, income from your business can
                    be
                    treated as your own personal income, and is therefore not subject to certain corporate taxes for
                    which companies are liable.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Separate Legal Entity:</strong> A LLP is a legal entity and a juristic person
                    established
                    under the Act. Therefore, a LLP has wide legal capacity and can own property and also incur
                    debts.
                    However, the Partners of a LLP have no liability to the creditors of a LLP for the debts of the
                    LLP.
                </p>

                <p><strong>4. Uninterrupted Existence:</strong> A LLP has 'perpetual succession', that is continued
                    or
                    uninterrupted existence until it is legally dissolved. A LLP being a separate legal person, is
                    unaffected by the death or other departure of any Partner. Hence, a LLP continues to be in
                    existence
                    irrespective of the changes in ownership.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Audit not Required:</strong> A LLP does not require audit if it has less than Rs. 40
                    lakhs
                    of turnover and less than Rs.25 lakhs of capital contribution. Therefore, LLPs are ideal for
                    startups and small businesses that are just starting their operations and want to have minimal
                    regulatory compliance related formalities.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Easy Transferability:</strong> The ownership of a LLP can be easily transferred to
                    another
                    person by inducting them as a Partner of the LLP. LLP is a separate legal entity separate from
                    its
                    Partners, so by changing the Partners, the ownership of the LLP can be changed.</p>

                <p><strong>7. Owning Property:</strong> A LLP being an artificial judicial person, can acquire, own,
                    enjoy and sell, property in its name. No Partner can make any claim upon the property of the LLP
                    -
                    so long as the LLP is a going concern.</p>
                <p class="c1">Advantages</p>

                <p><strong>1. Limited liability:</strong> As the name implies, members‘ liabilities for the debts
                    and
                    obligations of the LLC are limited to their own investment.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Pass-through taxation:</strong> For taxation purposes, income from your business can
                    be
                    treated as your own personal income, and is therefore not subject to certain corporate taxes for
                    which companies are liable.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Limitless ownership:</strong> Some legal structures limit the number of people allowed
                    to
                    file as owners. With an LLC, there is no limit to the number of owners. An LLC can have one
                    member
                    or hundreds of members.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Allocation flexibility:</strong> In an LLC, the amount of money that owners invest
                    into
                    the business doesn‘t need to equal their percentage of ownership. When an LLC is formed, members
                    create an operating agreement, in which different percentages of company profits and losses can
                    be
                    assigned to owners regardless of the amounts of their initial investments.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Freedom in management:</strong> Unlike standard companies, LLCs are not required to
                    have a
                    board of directors, annual meetings, or strict book requirements. This can free up a lot of time
                    and
                    stress to let you run your business on your own terms. As you can imagine, this can be an
                    important
                    advantage of a limited liability company as well.</p>
                <p class="c1">Disadvantages</p>

                <p><strong>1. Building capital:</strong> Unlike companies, which can issue stock in order to
                    increase
                    funds for their companies, LLCs have to work a little harder to find investors and sources of
                    capital due to the greater legal obligations to add a new member to an LLC. If you have a fast
                    growth internet company that needs venture capital to scale, this limitation is one of the major
                    disadvantages of a limited liability company.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Higher fees:</strong> LLCs must typically pay more fees to file as LLCs compared to
                    some
                    other business entities or sole proprietorships.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Government regulation:</strong> Because of the protections afforded to LLCs, some
                    types of
                    businesses are ineligible to file as LLCs. Banks, insurance companies, and medical service
                    companies
                    are examples of businesses that may be barred from filing.</p>

                <p><strong>4. Lack of case law:</strong> The LLC business form is a relatively new concept. As a
                    result,
                    not a lot of cases have been decided surrounding LLCs. Case law is important because of
                    predictability. If you know a court has ruled a certain way, you can act accordingly to protect
                    yourself.</p>

                <p><strong>5. Confusion About Roles:</strong> Whereas corporations have specific roles (like
                    directors,
                    managers, and employees), LLCs generally do not. This can make it difficult for the company and
                    especially investors to know who‘s in charge, who can sign certain contracts, etc. Some of this
                    confusion can be avoided by creating an LLC Operating Agreement.</p>

                <p><strong>6. Limited Life:</strong> In many jurisdictions, if a member departs the LLC, the LLC
                    ceases
                    to exist. This is unlike a corporation whose identity is unaffected by the comings and goings of
                    shareholders. Members of LLCs can combat this weakness in the Operating Agreement.</p>
