                <c1 class="c1">National Income</c1>

                <P>In every country goods and services are produced in agriculture sector, industrial sector and service
                    sector. The total value of final goods and services produced in a country in a year is called
                    national income. National income was first calculated in India by Dadabai Noaroji in 1876. In our
                    country national income is calculated every year by Central Statistical Organization (CSO). It
                    includes payments made to all resources in the form of wages, interest, rent and profits.</P>

                <P>According to Marshall: ―The labour and capital of a country acting on its natural resources produce
                    annually a certain net aggregate of commodities, material and immaterial including services of all
                    kinds. This is the true net annual income or revenue of the country or national dividend.‖ In this
                    definition, the word ‗net‘ refers to deductions from the gross national income in respect of
                    depreciation and wearing out of machines. And to this, must be added income from abroad.</P>

                <c1 class="c1">Circular Flow of National Income</c1>

                <P>National income is a flow of money payments resulting from the productive resources of a country
                    during a year. It has the concept of circular flow in this sense that the economic transactions
                    which are made in a country during a particular year appears in different ways. The expenditure of
                    one person is the income of another person, and his expenditure is also equal to value of goods and
                    services. To explain this idea we assume that there is economy where are only two sectors in the
                    economy.</P>

                <P><strong>1. Firms.</strong> </P>
                <P><strong>2. Households.</strong> </P>

                <P>Firms are required to produce goods. Households own the various factors of production. Firms require
                    the services of households to produce goods. The firms hire the services of households to produce
                    goods. These goods are again supplied to the households. When households sector purchases the goods
                    it makes the payments. Similarly firms make the payment in the shape of rent, wages, and interest to
                    the households against their services.</P>

                <P>In this way the sum of prices of the goods and services must be equal to the sum of the reward for
                    the services of factors of production.</P>

                <P>So income flows from firms to households in exchange for these services and again the expenditure
                    flows from households to firms. The goods which are produced by the firms these are purchased by the
                    household. The flow of income flows from firms to household and flow of expenditure from household
                    to firms will be equal. This is called circular flow of national income.</P>

                <P>National income can be calculated on the basis of:</P>

                <P><strong>1.</strong> Flow of goods and services</strong></P>
                <P><strong>2.</strong> Flow of income</strong></P>
                <P><strong>3.</strong>Flow of expenditure on goods and services</P>
                <c1 class="c1">Concepts Of National Income</c1>

                <P>There are various concepts of National Income. The main concepts of NI are: GDP, GNP, NNP, NI, PI,
                    DI, and PCI. These different concepts explain about the phenomenon of economic activities of the
                    various sectors of the economy.</P>

                <P><strong>1. Gross Domestic Product (GDP)</strong></P>

                <P>Gross domestic product - the market value of all final goods and services produced in a country
                    during a specific period of time which is usually one year.</P>

                <P>GDP is measured using market values, and not quantities. Production is measured in quantities, but
                    then those quantities have to be changed to account for their value. In economics we use prices to
                    place values on the final goods, so total production times price will give us the total value.</P>

                <P>Final goods and services vs intermediate goods or services. A product is a final good or service when
                    it is purchased by the final user. Intermediate products are used as an input to produce another
                    good or service such as sugar being purchased to make soda. Sugar is an intermediate good, while
                    soda is a final good.</P>

                <P>GDP only includes the value of final goods, intermediate goods are not included. GDP only includes
                    current production, and ignores the sale of used goods. If you purchase a bike in 2011, then that
                    purchase is included in 2011 GDP measure, not 2010 or 2012. Also, if you sell that bike at any time
                    in the future, the sale of that bike is not included in GDP.</P>

                <P>An equation for GDP and some actual values:</P>

                <P>GDP = C + I + G + NX</P>

                <P>The GDP equation shows us that GDP is equal to consumption expenditure (C) plus investment
                    expenditure (I) plus government expenditure (G) plus net exports (NX = Exports - Imports).</P>

                <P><strong>2. Gross National Product (GNP)</strong></P>

                <P>Gross National Product is the total market value of all final goods and services produced annually in
                    a country plus net factor income from abroad. Thus, GNP is the total measure of the flow of goods
                    and services at market value resulting from current production during a year in a country including
                    net factor income from abroad. The GNP can be expressed as the following equation:</P>

                <P>GNP = GDP + NFIA (Net Factor Income from Abroad)</P>

                <P>NFIA = Income earned by Indians in abroad through jobs or businesses – Income earned by foreigners in
                    India by jobs or businesses.</P>

                <P><strong>3. Net National Product (NNP)</strong></P>

                <P>Net National Product is the market value of all final goods and services after allowing for
                    depreciation. It is also called National Income at market price. When charges for depreciation are
                    deducted from the gross national product, we get it. Thus,</P>

                <P>NNP = GNP - Depreciation</P>

                <P><strong>4. National Income (NI)</strong></P>

                <P>National Income is also known as National Income at factor cost. National income at factor cost means
                    the sum of all incomes earned by resources suppliers for their contribution of land, labor, capital
                    and organizational ability which go into the years net production. Hence, the sum of the income
                    received by factors of production in the form of rent, wages, interest and profit is called National
                    Income. Symbolically,</P>

                <P>NI = NNP + Subsidies given by Govt. - Indirect Taxes</P>

                <P><strong>5. Personal Income (PI)</strong></P>

                <P>Personal Income is the total money income received by individuals and households of a country from
                    all possible sources before direct taxes. Therefore, personal income can be expressed as follows:
                </P>

                <P>PI = NI - Corporate Income Taxes - Undistributed Corporate Profits - Social Security Contribution +
                    Transfer Payments</P>

                <P><strong>6. Disposable Income (DI)</strong></P>

                <P>The income left after the payment of direct taxes from personal income is called Disposable Income.
                    Disposable income means actual income which can be spent on consumption by individuals and families.
                    Thus, it can be expressed as:</P>

                <P>DI = PI - Direct Taxes</P>

                <P><strong>7. Per Capita Income (PCI)</strong></P>

                <P>Per Capita Income (average income) of a country is derived by dividing the national income of the
                    country by the total population of a country. Thus,</P>

                <P>PCI = Total National Income / Total National Population</P>
                <c1 class="c1">Importance Of National Income</c1>

                <P>The following points highlight the top eleven reasons for growing importance of national income
                    studies in recent years.</P>

                <P><strong>1. Economic Policy:</strong></P>

                <P>Economic policy refers to the actions which Govt. Takes in the economic field such as Tax policy,
                    Money supply policy, Interest rate policy etc. National income figures are an important tool of
                    macroeconomic analysis and policy.</P>

                <P>National income estimates are the most comprehensive measures of aggregate economic activity in an
                    economy. It is through such estimates that we know the aggregate yield of the economy and can lay
                    down future economic policy for development.</P>

                <P><strong>2. Economic Planning:</strong></P>

                <P>National income statistics are the most important tools for long-term and short-term economic
                    planning. A country cannot possibly frame a plan without having a prior knowledge of the trends in
                    national income. The Planning Commission in India also kept in view the national income estimates
                    before formulating the five-year plans.</P>

                <P><strong>3. Economy‟s Structure:</strong></P>

                <P>National income statistics enable us to have clear idea about the structure of the economy. It
                    enables us to know the relative importance of the various sectors of the economy and their
                    contribution towards national income. From these studies we learn how income is produced, how it is
                    distributed, how much is spent, saved or taxed.</P>

                <P><strong>4. Inflationary and Deflationary Gaps:</strong></P>

                <P>Inflationary gap means the amount by which the total demand is higher than the total supply.
                    Deflationary gap means the amount by which the total demand is less than the total supply. National
                    income and national product figures enable us to have an idea of the inflationary and deflationary
                    gaps. For accurate and timely anti-inflationary and deflationary policies, we need regular estimates
                    of national income.</P>

                <P><strong>5. Budgetary Policies:</strong></P>

                <P>Modern governments try to prepare their budgets within the framework of national income data and try
                    to formulate anti-cyclical policies according to the facts revealed by the national income
                    estimates. Even the taxation and borrowing policies are so framed as to avoid fluctuations in
                    national income.</P>

                <P><strong>6. National Expenditure:</strong></P>

                <P>National income studies show how national expenditure is divided between consumption expenditure and
                    investment expenditure. It enables us to provide for reasonable depreciation to maintain the capital
                    stock of a community. Too liberal allowance of depreciation may prove harmful as it may
                    unnecessarily lead to a reduction in consumption.</P>

                <P><strong>7. Distribution of Grants-in-aid:</strong></P>

                <P>National income estimates help a fair distribution of grants-in-aid by the federal governments to the
                    state governments and other constituent units.</P>

                <P><strong>8. Standard of Living Comparison:</strong></P>

                <P>National income studies help us to compare the standards of living of people in different countries
                    and of people living in the same country at different times.</P>

                <P><strong>9. International Sphere:</strong></P>

                <P>National income studies are important even in the international sphere as these estimates not only
                    help us to fix the burden of international payments equitably amongst different nations but also
                    enable us to determine the subscriptions and quotas of different countries to international
                    organisations like the UNO, IMF, IBRD, etc.</P>

                <P><strong>10. Defense and Development:</strong></P>

                <P>National income estimates help us to divide the national product between defence and development
                    purposes. From such figures we can easily know how much can be spared for war by the civilian
                    population.</P>

                <P><strong>11. Public Sector:</strong></P>

                <P>National income figures enable us to know the relative roles of public and private sectors in the
                    economy. If most of the activities are performed by the state, we can easily conclude that public
                    sector is playing a dominant role.</P>
