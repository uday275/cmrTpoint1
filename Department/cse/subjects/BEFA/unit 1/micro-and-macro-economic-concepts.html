            <div class="main">
                <c1 class="c1">Micro and Macro Economics</c1>

                <P>The whole economic theory is broadly divided into two parts – Micro economics and Macro economics.
                    These two terms were at first used by Ragner Frisch in 1933. But these two words became popular
                    worldwide and most of the economist using nowadays. The term ‗micro‘ and ‗macro‘ were derived from
                    Greek words ‗Mikros‘ and ‗Makros‘ meaning ‗small‘ and ‗large‘ respectively. So micro economics deals
                    with the analysis of an individual unit and macro economics with economy as a whole. For example, in
                    micro economics we study how price of goods or factors of production are determined. In macro
                    economics we study what are the causes of high or low level of employment. So, according to Edwin
                    Mansfield – ―Micro economics deals with the economic behaviour of individual units such as
                    consumers, firms, and resource owners; while macro economics deals with behaviour of economic
                    aggregates such as gross national product and the level of employment.</P>

                <c1 class="c1">Meaning of Micro – economics</c1>

                <P>The term micro was originated from Greek word ‗Mikros‘ which means small. Hence, microeconomics is
                    concerned on small economic units like as individual consumer, households, firms, industry etc.</P>

                <P>Microeconomics may be defined as the branch of economic analysis which studies about the economic
                    behaviour of individual economic unit may be a person, a particular households, a particular firm
                    and an industry. The main objective of micro – economics is to explain the principles, problems and
                    policies related to the optimum allocation of resources. According to K. E. Boulding,
                    ―Microeconomics is the study of particular firm, particular households, individual price, wage,
                    income of the industry and particular commodity‖.</P>

                <P>It is the study of individual tree not a whole forest. Hence, microeconomics tries to explain how an
                    individual allocates his money income among various needs as well as how an individual maximize
                    satisfaction level from the consumption of available limited resources. Microeconomics also explains
                    about the process of determination of individual price with interaction of demand and supply. It
                    helps to determine the price of the product and factor inputs. Therefore, it is also called as price
                    theory or demand and supply theory. Simply microeconomics is microscopic study of the economy.</P>
                <c1 class="c1">Meaning of Macro - economics</c1>

                <P>The term macro-economics is derived from Greek word ―Makros‖, which means ―big‖. Hence,
                    macro-economics studies not individual units but all the units combined together or the economy as a
                    whole. Since it studies the economy in aggregate. It studies national income, national output,
                    general price level, total employment, total savings, total investment and so on. It is also called
                    ―aggregate economics‖ or the ―income theory‖.</P>

                <P><strong>According to K.E. Boulding –</strong> ―Macro-economics deals not with individual quantities
                    but with aggregate
                    of these quantities, not with individual incomes, but with national income, not with individual
                    prices but with price level, not with individual output but with national output.‖</P>

                <P><strong>J.M. Keynes</strong> made an outstanding contribution in the development of macro-economics.
                    It is also known
                    as Keynesian Phenomenon.</P>
