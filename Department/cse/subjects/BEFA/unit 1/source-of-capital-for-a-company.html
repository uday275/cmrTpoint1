                <p class="c1">Sources of Capital for a Company</p>

                <p class="c1">Sources of raising long-term capital:</p>

                <p><strong>1) Issue of Shares:</strong> The amount of capital decided to be raised from members of the
                    public is divided into units of equal value. These units are known as share and the aggregate values
                    of shares are known as share capital of the company. Those who subscribe to the share capital become
                    members of the company and are called shareholders. They are the owners of the company.</p>

                <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;a) Issue of Preference Shares:</strong> Preference share have three distinct
                    characteristics.
                    Preference shareholders have the right to claim dividend at a fixed rate, which is decided according
                    to the terms of issue of shares. Moreover, the preference dividend is to be paid first out of the
                    net profit. The balance, it any, can be distributed among other shareholders that is, equity
                    shareholders. However, payment of dividend is not legally compulsory. Only when dividend is
                    declared, preference shareholders have a prior claim over equity shareholders.</p>
                <p>Preference shareholders also have the preferential right of claiming repayment of capital in the
                    event of winding up of the company. Preference capital has to be repaid out of assets after meeting
                    the loan obligations and claims of creditors but before any amount is repaid to equity shareholders.
                </p>

                <p><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;b) Issue of Equity Shares:</strong> The most important source of raising
                    long-term capital
                    for a company is the issue of equity shares. In the case of equity shares there is no promise to
                    shareholders a fixed dividend. But if the company is successful and the level profits are high,
                    equity shareholders enjoy very high returns on their investment. This feature is very attractive to
                    many investors even though they run the risk of having no return if the profits are inadequate or
                    there is loss. They have the right of control over the management of the company and their liability
                    is limited to the value of shares held by them.</p>

                <p><strong>2) Issue of Debentures:</strong> When a company decides to raise loans from the public, the
                    amount of loan is divided into units of equal. These units are known as debentures. A debenture is
                    the instrument or certificate issued by a company to acknowledge its debt. Those who invest money in
                    debentures are known as ‗debenture holders‘. They are creditors of the company. Debentures carry a
                    fixed rate of interest, and generally are repayable after a certain period.</p>

                <p><strong>3) Loans from financial Institutions:</strong> Government with the main object of promoting
                    industrial development has set up a number of financial institutions. These institutions play an
                    important role as sources of company finance. These institutions provide medium and long-term
                    finance to industrial enterprises at a reason able rate of interest. Thus companies may obtain
                    direct loan from the financial institutions for expansion or modernization of existing manufacturing
                    units or for starting a new unit.</p>

                <p><strong>4) Retained Profits:</strong> Successful companies do not distribute the whole of their
                    profits as dividend to shareholders but reinvest a part of the profits. The amount of profit
                    reinvested in the business of a company is known as retained profit.</p>

                <p><strong>5) Public Deposits:</strong> An important source of medium – term finance which companies
                    make use of is public deposits. This requires advertisement to be issued inviting the general public
                    of deposits. Against the deposit, the company mentioning the amount, rate of interest, time of
                    repayment and such other information issues a receipt.</p>
                <p class="c1">Sources of raising short-term capital:</p>

                <p><strong>1) Trade credit:</strong> Trade credit is a common source of short-term finance available to
                    all companies. It refers to the amount payable to the suppliers of raw materials, goods etc. after
                    an agreed period, which is generally less than a year. It is customary for all business firms to
                    allow credit facility to their customers in trade business. Thus, it is an automatic source of
                    finance.</p>

                <p><strong>2) Bank loans and advances:</strong> Money advanced or granted as loan by commercial banks is
                    known as bank credit. Companies generally secure bank credit to meet their current operating
                    expenses. The most common forms are cash credit and overdraft facilities. Under the cash credit
                    arrangement, the maximum limit of credit is fixed in advance on the security of goods and materials
                    in stock.</p>

                <p><strong>3) Overdraft:</strong> In the case of overdraft, the company is allowed to overdraw its
                    current account up to the sanctioned limit. This facility is also allowed either against personal
                    security or the security of assets. Interest is charged on the amount actually overdrawn, not on the
                    sanctioned limit.</p>

                <p><strong>4) Discounting of Bills:</strong> Commercial banks also advance money by discounting bills of
                    exchange. A company having sold goods on credit may draw bills of exchange on the customers for
                    their acceptance. A bill is an order in writing requiring the customer to pay the specified amount
                    after a certain period (say 60 days or 90 days). After acceptance of the bill, the company can drawn
                    the amount as an advance from many commercial banks on payment of a discount. The amount of
                    discount, which is equal to the interest for the period of the bill, and the balance, is available
                    to the company. Bill discounting is thus another source of short-term finance available from the
                    commercial banks.</p>

                <p><strong>5) Short term loans from finance companies:</strong> Short-term funds may be available from
                    finance companies on the security of assets. Some finance companies also provide funds according to
                    the value of bills receivable or amount due from the customers of the borrowing company, which they
                    take over.</p>
