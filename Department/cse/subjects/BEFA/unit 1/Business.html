                <c1 class="c1">Introduction</c1>
                <p>Human beings are continuously engaged in some activity or other in order to
                    satisfy their unlimited wants. Every day we come across the word 'business' or
                    'businessman' directly or indirectly. Business has become essential part of
                    modern world.</p>
                <p>Business is an economic activity, which is related with continuous and regular
                    production and distribution of goods and services for satisfying human wants.
                </p>
                <p>All of us need food, clothing and shelter. We also have many other household
                    requirements to be satisfied in our daily lives. We met these requirements from
                    the shopkeeper. The shopkeeper gets from wholesaler. The wholesaler gets from
                    manufacturers. The shopkeeper, the wholesaler, the manufacturer are doing
                    business and therefore they are called as Businessman.</p>



                <c1 class="c1">Definitions</c1>
                <p><strong>Stephenson</strong> defines business as, "The regular production or purchase and sale
                    of goods undertaken with an objective of earning profit and acquiring wealth
                    through the satisfaction of human wants."</p>
                <p><strong>Dicksee</strong> business as "a form of activity conducted with an objective of
                    earning profits for the benefit of those on whose behalf the activity is
                    conducted."
                </p>
                <p><strong>Lewis Henry</strong> business as, "Human activity directed towards producing
                    or acquiring wealth through buying and selling of goods."</p>
                <p>Thus, the term business means continuous production and distribution of goods
                    and services with the aim of earning profits under uncertain market conditions.
                </p>

                    due to change in demand or fall in price cannot be insured and must be borne by
