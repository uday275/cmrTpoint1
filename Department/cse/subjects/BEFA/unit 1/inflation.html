                <c1 class="c1">Inflation</c1>

                <P><strong>Inflation</strong> is defined as a sustained increase in the general level of prices for
                    goods and services in a country, and is measured as an annual percentage change. Under conditions of
                    inflation, the prices of things rise over time. Put differently, as inflation rises, every rupee you
                    own buys a smaller percentage of a good or service. When prices rise, and alternatively when the
                    value of money falls you have inflation.</P>

                <P>The value of a rupee (or any unit of money) is expressed in terms of its purchasing power, which is
                    the amount of real, tangible goods or actual services that money can buy at a moment in time. When
                    inflation goes up, there is a decline in the purchasing power of money. For example, if the
                    inflation rate is 2% annually, then theoretically a Rs.1 chocolate will cost Rs.1.02 in a year.
                    After inflation, your rupee does not go as far as it did in the past.</P>
                <c1 class="c1">Features Of Inflation</c1>

                <P>Following are the main features of inflation:</P>

                <P><strong>1. Inflation is always accompanied by a rise in the price level.</strong> It is a process of
                    uninterrupted increase in prices.</P>

                <P><strong>2. Inflation is a monetary phenomenon</strong> and it is generally caused by excessive money
                    supply.</P>

                <P><strong>3. Inflation is essentially an economic phenomenon</strong> as it originates in the economic
                    system and is the result of action and interaction of economic forces.</P>

                <P><strong>4. Inflation is a dynamic process</strong> as observed over the long period.</P>

                <P><strong>5. A cyclical movement of prices is not inflation.</strong></P>

                <P><strong>6. Pure inflation starts after full employment.</strong></P>

                <P><strong>7. Inflation may be demand-pull or cost-push.</strong></P>
                <c1 class="c1">Types Of Inflation</c1>

                <P><strong>1. Creeping Inflation:</strong> This is also known as mild inflation or moderate inflation.
                    This type of inflation occurs when the price level persistently rises over a period of time at a
                    mild rate. When the rate of inflation is less than 10 per cent annually, or it is a single digit
                    inflation rate, it is considered to be a moderate inflation.</P>

                <P><strong>2. Galloping Inflation:</strong> If mild inflation is not checked and if it is
                    uncontrollable, it may assume the character of galloping inflation. Inflation in the double or
                    triple digit range of 20, 100 or 200 percent a year is called galloping inflation. Many Latin
                    American countries such as Argentina, Brazil had inflation rates of 50 to 700 percent per year in
                    the 1970s and 1980s.</P>

                <P><strong>3. Hyperinflation:</strong> It is a stage of very high rate of inflation. While economies
                    seem to survive under galloping inflation, a third and deadly strain takes hold when the cancer of
                    hyperinflation strikes. Nothing good can be said about a market economy in which prices are rising a
                    million or even a trillion percent per year. Hyperinflation occurs when the prices go out of control
                    and the monetary authorities are unable to impose any check on it. Germany had witnessed
                    hyperinflation in the 1920s.</P>

                <P><strong>4. Stagflation:</strong> It is an economic situation in which unemployment increases along
                    with rising inflation causing demand to remain stagnant in a given period. In fact, it is an
                    indication of an inefficient market, as traditionally, there is an inverse relationship between
                    unemployment rates and inflationary pressures. Stagflation was witnessed by developed countries in
                    the 1970s, when world oil prices rose dramatically.</P>

                <P><strong>5. Deflation:</strong> Deflation is the reverse of inflation. It refers to a sustained
                    decline in the price level of goods and services. It occurs when the annual inflation rate falls
                    below zero percent (a negative inflation rate), resulting in an increase in the real value of money.
                    Japan suffered from deflation for almost a decade in the 1990s.</P>
