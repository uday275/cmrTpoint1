                <c1 class="c1">Non-Conventional Source of Finance</c1>
                <p class="c1">1. Venture capital</p>

                <p><strong>Venture capital</strong> is financing that investors provide to start-up companies and small
                    businesses that are believed to have long-term growth potential. Venture capital generally comes
                    from venture capital firms, which comprise of professionally well-off investors, investment banks
                    and any other financial institutions. However, it does not always take just a monetary form; it can
                    be provided in the form of technical or managerial expertise.</p>

                <p>Though it can be risky for the investors who put up the funds, the potential for above-average
                    returns is an attractive payoff. For new companies or ventures that have a limited operating history
                    (under two years), venture capital funding is increasingly becoming a popular – even essential –
                    source for raising capital, especially if they lack access to capital markets, bank loans or other
                    debt instruments. The main downside is that the investors usually get equity in the company, and
                    thus a say in company decisions.</p>

                <p>In a venture capital deal, large ownership chunks of a company are created and sold to a few
                    investors through independent limited partnerships that are established by venture capital firms.
                    Sometimes these partnerships consist of a pool of several similar enterprises. One important
                    difference between venture capital and other private equity deals, however, is that venture capital
                    tends to focus on emerging companies seeking substantial funds for the first time, while private
                    equity tends to fund larger, more established companies that are seeking an equity infusion or a
                    chance for company founders to transfer some of their ownership stake.</p>

                <p class="c1">2. Angel Investors</p>

                <p><strong>An angel investor</strong> is a person who invests in a business venture, providing capital
                    for start-up or expansion. Angel investors are typically individuals who have spare cash available
                    and are looking for a higher rate of return than would be given by more traditional investments. An
                    angel investment is a form of equity financing - the investor supplies funding in exchange for
                    taking an equity position in the company.</p>

                <p class="c1">3. Private Equity</p>

                <p><strong>Private equity</strong> is capital that is not noted on a public exchange. Private equity is
                    composed of funds and investors that directly invest in private companies, or that engage in buyouts
                    of public companies, resulting in the delisting of public equity. Institutional and retail investors
                    provide the capital for private equity, and the capital can be utilized to fund new technology, make
                    acquisitions, expand working capital, and to bolster and solidify a balance sheet.</p>

                <p>Private equity comes primarily from institutional investors and accredited investors, who can
                    dedicate substantial sums of money for extended time periods. In most cases, considerably long
                    holding periods are often required for private equity investments, in order to ensure a turnaround
                    for distressed companies or to enable liquidity events such as an initial public offering (IPO) or a
                    sale to a public company.</p>

                <p class="c1">4. IPO</p>

                <p><strong>An initial public offering</strong>, or IPO, is the very first sale of stock issued by a
                    company to the public. Prior to an IPO the company is considered private, with a relatively small
                    number of shareholders made up primarily of early investors (such as the founders, their families
                    and friends) and professional investors (such as venture capitalists or angel investors). The
                    public, on the other hand, consists of everybody else – any individual or institutional investor who
                    wasn‘t involved in the early days of the company and who is interested in buying shares of the
                    company. Until a company‘s stock is offered for sale to the public, the public is unable to invest
                    in it. You can potentially approach the owners of a private company about investing, but they're not
                    obligated to sell you anything. Public companies, on the other hand, have sold at least a portion of
                    their shares to the public to be traded on a stock exchange. This is why an IPO is also referred to
                    as "going public."</p>
