                <c1 class="c1">Introduction</c1>



                <P>Business Economics, also called Managerial Economics, is the application of economic theory and
                    methodology to business. Business involves decision-making. Decision making means the process of
                    selecting one out of two or more alternative courses of action. The question of choice arises
                    because the basic resources such as capital, land, labor, and management are limited and can be
                    employed in alternative uses. The decision-making function thus becomes one of making choice and
                    taking decisions that will provide the most efficient means of attaining a desired end, say, profit
                    maximization. Different aspects of business need the attention of the chief executive. He may be
                    called upon to choose a single option among the many that may be available to him. It would be in
                    the interest of the business to reach an optimal decision- the one that promotes the goal of the
                    business firm. A scientific formulation of the business problem and finding its optimal solution
                    requires that the business firm is equipped with a rational methodology and appropriate tools.</P>

                <P>Economic theory underscores the fact that each firm in the industry operates under competitive
                    conditions and hence tries to operate more efficiently to withstand the competition. The indicator
                    of efficiency is profits. The assumption here is that each firm has one man as the owner and
                    entrepreneur, and that his sole aim is to maximize profits. As time passed, one-man firms were
                    replaced by partnerships and giant companies and the structure of the firm changed to include the
                    owner/entrepreneur/shareholders on the one hand and managers on the other. The responsibility of the
                    owners/entrepreneur/shareholders got bifurcated. The day-to-day affairs of the firm were looked
                    after by the managers and owners/entrepreneur/shareholders took organizational decisions aimed at
                    maximizing profits. The goals of the owners/entrepreneurs/shareholders are called organizational
                    goals while the goals of the managers are referred to as business goals also known as operational
                    goals.</P>


                <c1 class="c1">Definitions</c1>
                <P>According to E. F. Brigham and J. L. Pappas, "Managerial Economics is the application of Economic
                    theory and methodology to business administration practise."</P>

                <P>According to McNair and Meriam, "Managerial Economics consists of the use of Economic modes of
                    thought to analyse business situations."</P>

                <P>According to M. H. Spencer and L. Siegelman, "Managerial Economics is the integration of economic
                    theory with business practise for the purpose of facilitating decision making and forward planning."
                </P>

                <P>According to Hauge, "Managerial Economics is concerned with using logic of economics, mathematics &
                    statistics to provide effective ways of thinking about business decision problems."</P>

                <P>According to Joel Dean, "The purpose of Managerial Economics is to show how economic analysis can be
                    used in formulating business policies."</P>

                <c1 class="c1">Nature Of Business Economics</c1>
                <P>Business economics is, perhaps, the youngest of all the social sciences. Since it originates from
                    Economics, it has the basis features of economics, such as assuming that other things remaining the
                    same. This assumption is made to simplify the complexity of the Business phenomenon under study in a
                    dynamic business environment so many things are changing simultaneously. This set a limitation that
                    we cannot really hold other things remaining the same. In such a case, the observations made out of
                    such a study will have a limited purpose or value. Managerial economics also has inherited this
                    problem from economics.</P>

                <P>The other features of managerial economics are explained as below:</P>

                <P><strong>(a) Microeconomics in nature:</strong> Business economics is concerned with finding the
                    solutions for different managerial problems of a particular firm. Thus, it is more close to
                    microeconomics.</P>

                <P><strong>(b) Operates against the backdrop of macroeconomics:</strong> The macroeconomics conditions
                    of the economy are also seen as limiting factors for the firm to operate. In other words, the
                    managerial economist has to be aware of the limits set by the macroeconomics conditions such as
                    government industrial policy, inflation and so on.</P>

                <P><strong>(c) Normative economics:</strong> Economics can be classified into two broad categories
                    normally. Positive Economics and Normative Economics. Positive economics describes “what is” i.e.,
                    observed economic phenomenon. The statement “Poverty in India is very high” is an example of
                    positive economics. Normative economics describes “what ought to be” i.e., it differentiates the
                    ideals from the actual. Ex: People who earn high incomes ought to pay more income tax than those who
                    earn low incomes. A normative statement usually includes or implies the words ‘ought’ or ‘should’.
                    They reflect people’s moral attitudes and are expressions of what a team of people ought to do.</P>

                <P><strong>(d) Prescriptive actions:</strong> Prescriptive action is goal oriented. Given a problem and
                    the objectives of the firm, it suggests the course of action from the available alternatives for
                    optimal solution. It does not merely mention the concept, it also explains whether the concept can
                    be applied in a given context on not. For instance, the fact that variable costs as marginal costs
                    can be used to judge the feasibility of an export order.</P>

                <P><strong>(e) Applied in nature:</strong> ‘Models’ are built to reflect the real life complex business
                    situations and these models are of immense help to managers for decision-making. The different areas
                    where models are extensively used include inventory control, optimization, project management etc.
                    In Business economics, we also employ case study methods to conceptualize the problem, identify that
                    alternative and determine the best course of action.</P>

                <P><strong>(f) Offers scope to evaluate each alternative:</strong> Business economics provides an
                    opportunity to evaluate each alternative in terms of its costs and revenue. The Business economist
                    can decide which is the better alternative to maximize the profits for the firm.</P>

                <P><strong>(g) Interdisciplinary:</strong> The contents, tools and techniques of Business economics are
                    drawn from different subjects such as economics, management, mathematics, statistics, accountancy,
                    psychology, organizational behavior, sociology and etc.</P>

                <P><strong>(h) Assumptions and limitations:</strong> Every concept and theory of Business economics is
                    based on certain assumption and as such their validity is not universal. Where there is change in
                    assumptions, the theory may not hold good at all.</P>

                <c1 class="c1">Scope Of Business Economics</c1>

                <P>The main focus of Business economics is to find the solution to Business problems for which the
                    Business economist makes use of the concepts, tools and techniques of economics and other related
                    disciplines.</P>

                <P><strong>1. Demand Analyses and Forecasting:</strong></P>

                <P>A firm can survive only if it is able to the demand for its product at the right time, within the
                    right quantity. Understanding the basic concepts of demand is essential for demand forecasting.
                    Demand analysis should be a basic activity of the firm because many of the other activities of the
                    firms depend upon the outcome of the demand forecast. Demand analysis provides:</P>

                <P>a) The basis for analyzing market influences on the firms; products and thus helps in the adaptation
                    to those influences.</P>

                <P>b) Demand analysis also highlights for factors, which influence the demand for a product. This helps
                    to manipulate demand. Thus demand analysis studies not only the price elasticity but also income
                    elasticity, cross elasticity as well as the influence of advertising expenditure. With the advent of
                    computers, demand forecasting has become an increasingly important function of Business economics.
                </P>

                <P><strong>2. Price determination:</strong></P>

                <P>Pricing decisions have been always within the preview of Business economics. Pricing policies are
                    merely a subset of broader class of Business economic problems. Price theory helps to explain how
                    prices are determined under different types of market conditions. Competition analysis includes the
                    anticipation of the response of competing firms‘ pricing, advertising and marketing strategies.
                    Product line pricing and price forecasting occupy an important place here.</P>

                <P><strong>3. Production and cost analysis:</strong></P>

                <P>Production analysis is in physical terms. While the cost analysis is in monetary terms. Cost concepts
                    and classifications, cost-out-put relationships, economies and diseconomies of scale and production
                    functions are some of the points constituting cost and production analysis.</P>

                <P><strong>4. Resource Allocation:</strong></P>

                <P>Business Economics is the traditional economic theory that is concerned with the problem of optimum
                    allocation of scarce resources. Marginal analysis is applied to the problem of determining the level
                    of output, which maximizes profit. In this respect, linear programming techniques are used to solve
                    optimization problems. In fact, linear programming is one of the most practical and powerful
                    managerial decision making tools currently available.</P>

                <P><strong>5. Profit analysis:</strong></P>

                <P>Profit making is the major goal of firms. There are several constraints here on account of
                    competition from other products, changing input prices and changing business environment hence in
                    spite of careful planning, there is always certain risk involved. Business economics deals with
                    techniques of averting of minimizing risks. Profit theory guides in the measurement and management
                    of profit, in calculating the pure return on capital, besides future profit planning.</P>

                <P><strong>6. Investment decisions:</strong></P>

                <P>Capital is the foundation of business. Lack of capital may result in small size of operations.
                    Availability of capital from various sources like equity capital, institutional finance etc. may
                    help to undertake large-scale operations. Hence efficient allocation and management of capital is
                    one of the most important tasks of the managers. The major issues related to capital analysis are:
                </P>

                <P>1. The choice of investment project</P>

                <P>2. Evaluation of the efficiency of capital</P>

                <P>3. Most efficient allocation of capital</P>

                <P>Knowledge of capital theory can help very much in taking investment decisions. This involves, capital
                    budgeting, feasibility studies, analysis of cost of capital etc.</P>

                <P><strong>7. Forward planning:</strong></P>

                <P>Strategic planning provides management with a framework on which long-term decisions can be made
                    which has an impact on the behavior of the firm. The firm sets certain long-term goals and
                    objectives and selects the strategies to achieve the same. Strategic planning is now a new addition
                    to the scope of Business economics with the emergence of multinational corporations. The perspective
                    of strategic planning is global.</P>
