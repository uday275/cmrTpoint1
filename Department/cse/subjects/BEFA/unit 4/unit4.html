                <p>The purpose of any business is to make profits; for that, some business activities are to be
                    conducted. You may be involved in transactions daily. Any human activity directed at making a profit
                    is called business. Business is of different types. It may be a trading activity or manufacturing
                    activity. Business may require capital, which may be the owner's capital and borrowed capital.
                    Transactions involve the exchange of value like the purchase of goods, the sale of goods for cash or
                    credit, and the payment of expenses in the course of production and distribution.</p>

                <div class="c1">History of Accounting</div>

                <p>Accounting is as old as civilization itself. From the ancient relics of Babylon, it can be well
                    proved that accounting did exist as long as 2600 B.C. However, in modern form, accounting based on
                    the principles of the Double Entry System came into existence in the 17th Century. Fra Luka Paciolo,
                    a mathematician, published a book <em>De computic et scripturies</em> in 1494 at Venice in Italy.
                    This book was translated into English in 1543. In this book, he covered a brief section on
                    'book-keeping'.</p>

                <div class="c1">Origin of Accounting in India</div>

                <p>Accounting was practiced in India thousands of years ago, and there is clear evidence for this. In
                    his famous book <em>Arthashastra</em>, Kautilya dealt with not only politics and economics but also
                    the art of proper keeping of accounts. However, accounting on modern lines was introduced in India
                    after 1850 with the formation of joint-stock companies in India.</p>

                <p>Accounting in India is now a fast-developing discipline. The two premier Accounting Institutes in
                    India, viz., Chartered Accountants of India and the Institute of Cost and Works Accountants of
                    India, are making continuous and substantial contributions. The International Accounts Standards
                    Committee (IASC) was established on 29th June. In India, the 'Accounting Standards Board (ASB)' is
                    formulating 'Accounting Standards' on the lines of standards framed by the International Accounting
                    Standards Committee.</p>
