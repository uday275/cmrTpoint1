                <p>Balance sheets and profit and loss accounts show the financial status and profitability of a firm
                    respectively. A balance sheet discloses the value of fixed assets and current assets, and the
                    increase or decrease of all assets and liabilities can be ascertained by comparing it with the
                    previous balance sheet. However, it does not disclose the reasons for these changes. To know these
                    reasons, a "Funds Flow Statement" is prepared. In this context, 'fund' means "net working capital".
                </p>

                <div class="c1">What is ‘FUND’ and ‘FLOW’?</div>
                <p>A layman can describe the word FUND as cash or cash equivalents. In technical terms, the word FUND
                    means ‘Net Working Capital’. Funds may mean:</p>
                <p><strong>- Cash only</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- Net working capital, i.e., current assets less current liabilities</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- Total resources or total funds</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- Internal resources only</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- Net worth, i.e., owner’s equity capital plus reserves</strong></p>

                <p>The term FLOW refers to change or transfer. The term ‘Fund flow’ or ‘Flow of funds’ may thus mean
                    transport of:</p>
                <p><strong>- One asset to another</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- One liability to another</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- Assets to liabilities or vice versa</strong></p>
                <p><strong>- The changes in working capital are also an inflow or outflow of funds, and thus it is
                        called
                        fund flow.</strong></p>

                <p>“Fund” is considered as working capital while preparing “Funds flow statement”. Fund flow means
                    change in the working capital. In other words, any increase or decrease in working capital means
                    “flow of funds”. Any transaction which has one current account and the other non-current account
                    results in change in the working capital.</p>

                <div class="c1">Current and Non-current Accounts</div>
                <p>Current accounts: Current assets accounts and current liabilities accounts are called current
                    accounts. Assets which are converted into cash within a year are called current assets. Liabilities
                    which are to be paid within a year are called current liabilities.</p>
                <p>Non-current account: Accounts which are not current accounts are called non-current accounts. For
                    example, fixed assets accounts, long-term liabilities accounts, and capital & reserves accounts.</p>

                <div class="c1">Preparation of Funds Flow Statements</div>
                <p>Funds flow statement is prepared by observing the items taken place during the periods of two balance
                    sheets along with the adjustments into consideration.</p>

                <p>Three statements are to be prepared:</p>

                <p>This statement reveals the net change in the working capital (CA – CL). Current assets and current

                    1. The figures of current assets and current liabilities of two balance sheets given are recorded in
                    the respective columns provided. Don’t take the adjustments. Then find working capital and
                    increase/decrease in working capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                    2. By observing the current assets and current liabilities, the differences are shown in the working
                    capital columns against each account and balance those columns. Increase or decrease in working
                    capital can be recognized as follows:

                <p>
                    1. Prepare the accounts for the items given in the adjustments to know the hidden information.
                    Generally, the hidden information is as follows:
                </p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Purchase price of a fixed asset</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Sale value of a fixed asset</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Profit/loss on sale of a fixed asset</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Depreciation provided</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Depreciation of the asset sold</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Provision for tax for the year</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Tax paid during the year</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Dividend proposed during the year</strong></p>
                <p><strong>&#9733; Dividend paid during the year</strong></p>

                <p>
                    2. By observing balance sheets and accounts for adjustments, non-operating expenses and non-cash
                    payment items (debit items of profit and loss account) are to be added to given net profit, and all
                    non-operating incomes & non-cash received items (credit items of profit and loss A/C) are to be
                    deducted from given net profit to find the funds from operations.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    When tax paid is not given, it is considered that the tax provided in the previous year is
                    paid in the current year.

                </figure>


                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    When dividend paid is not given, it is considered that the dividend proposed in the previous
                    year is paid in the present year.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    It can be found even if any one of the items is not given in the above said accounts. </p>
                <p>

                    In case
                    provision for tax and proposed dividend are taken as current liabilities, there is no need to
                    prepare those accounts. These should be shown in the “statement of changes in working capital” only.
                </p>
                <p> If these both are taken as an appropriation of profit (unlike current liabilities), there is a need
                    to prepare their accounts to know the hidden information. Provision for tax and proposed dividend
                    are to be added to the net profit to know the funds from operations and tax paid & dividend paid are
                    shown on the applications’ side in the funds flow statement.
                </p>

                </p>

                <div class="c1">Advantages of Fund Flow Statements</div>
                <p>1. Funds flow statement reveals the net result of business operations done by the company during the
                    year.</p>
                <p>2. In addition to the balance sheet, it serves as an additional reference for many interested parties
                    like analysts, creditors, suppliers, and the government to look into the financial position of the
                    company.</p>
                <p>3. The Fund Flow Statement shows how the funds were raised from various sources and also how those
                    funds were deployed by the company.</p>
                <p>4. It reveals the causes for the changes in liabilities and assets between the two balance sheet
                    dates.</p>
                <p>5. Funds flow statement helps the management in deciding its future course of plans and also acts as
                    a control tool for the management.</p>
                <div class="c1">Disadvantages of Fund Flow Statements</div>
                <p>1. Funds Flow statement has to be used along with the balance sheet and profit and loss account for
                    inference of financial strengths and weaknesses of a company; it cannot be used alone.</p>
                <p>2. Fund Flow Statement does not reveal the cash position of the company, and that is why the company
                    has to prepare a cash flow statement in addition to the funds flow statement.</p>
                <p>3. Funds flow statement only rearranges the data which is there in the books of account and therefore
                    it lacks originality.</p>
                <p>4. Funds flow statement is basically historic in nature, that is, it indicates what happened in the
                    past and it does not communicate anything about the future; only estimates can be made based on the
                    past data and therefore it cannot be used by the management for taking decisions related to the
                    future.</p>
                <div class="c1">Cash Flow Analysis</div>

                <p>A Cash Flow Statement is a statement showing changes in cash position of the firm from one period to
                    another. It explains the inflows (receipts) and outflows (disbursements) of cash over a period of
                    time. The inflows of cash may occur from sale of goods, sale of assets, receipts from debtors,
                    interest, dividend, rent, issue of new shares and debentures, raising of loans, short-term
                    borrowing, etc. The cash outflows may occur on account of purchase of goods, purchase of assets,
                    payment of loans loss on operations, payment of tax and dividend, etc.</p>

                <p>The cash flow statement shows how much cash comes in and goes out of the company over the quarter or
                    the year. At first glance, that sounds a lot like the income statement in that it records financial
                    performance over a specified period. But there is a big difference between the two.</p>

                <p>What distinguishes the two is accrual accounting, which is found on the income statement. Accrual
                    accounting requires companies to record revenues and expenses when transactions occur, not when cash
                    is exchanged. At the same time, the income statement, on the other hand, often includes non-cash
                    revenues or expenses, which the statement of cash flows does not include.</p>

                <p>Just because the income statement shows net income of Rs.10 does not mean that cash on the balance
                    sheet will increase by Rs.10. Whereas when the bottom of the cash flow statement reads Rs.10 net
                    cash inflow, that's exactly what it means. The company has Rs.10 more in cash than at the end of the
                    last financial period. You may want to think of net cash from operations as the company's "true"
                    cash profit.</p>

                <p>Because it shows how much actual cash a company has generated, the statement of cash flows is
                    critical to understanding a company's fundamentals. It shows how the company is able to pay for its
                    operations and future growth.</p>

                <p>Indeed, one of the most important features you should look for in a potential investment is the
                    company's ability to produce cash. Just because a company shows a profit on the income statement
                    doesn't mean it cannot get into trouble later because of insufficient cash flows. A close
                    examination of the cash flow statement can give investors a better sense of how the company will
                    fare.</p>

                <p>2. A decrease in current assets leads to an increase in cash.</p>
                <p>3. An increase in current liabilities leads to an increase in cash.</p>
                <p>4. A decrease in current liabilities leads to a decrease in cash.</p>

                <div class="c1">Preparing A Cash Flow Statement

                </div>

                <p>Cash flow statements have three distinct sections, each of which relates to a particular component –
                    operations, investing and financing – of a company's business activities.</p>

                <p>The indirect method of presentation is very popular, because the information required for it is
                    relatively easily assembled from the accounts that a business normally maintains in its chart of
                    accounts. The indirect method is less favoured by the standard-setting bodies, since it does not
                    give a clear view of how cash flows through a business. The alternative reporting method is the
                    direct method.</p>

                <p><strong>Three Sections of the Cash Flow Statement</strong></p>
                <p>Companies produce and consume cash in different ways, so the cash flow statement is divided into
                    three sections: cash flows from operations, financing and investing. Basically, the sections on
                    operations and financing show how the company gets its cash, while the investing section shows how
                    the company spends its cash.</p>

                <p><strong>1. Operating Activities:</strong> Operating activities include cash flows from all standard
                    business operations. Cash receipts from selling goods and services represent the inflows. The
                    revenues from interest and dividends are also included here. The operational expenditures are
                    considered as outflows for this section. Although interest expenses fall under this section but the
                    dividends are not included. Dividends are considered as a part of financing activity in financial
                    accounting terms.</p>

                <p><strong>2. Investing Activities:</strong> Investing activities include transactions with assets,
                    marketable securities and credit instruments. The sale of property, plant and equipment or
                    marketable securities is a cash inflow. Purchasing property, plant and equipment or marketable
                    securities are considered as cash outflows. Loans made to borrowers for long-term use is another
                    cash outflow. Collections from these loans, however, are cash inflows.</p>

                <p><strong>3. Financing Activities:</strong> Financing activities on the statement of cash flows are
                    much more defined in nature. The receipts come from borrowing money or issuing stock. The outflows
                    occur when a company repays loans, purchases treasury stock or pays dividends to stockholders. As
                    the case with other activities on the statement of cash flows depend on activities rather than
                    actual general ledger accounts.</p>

                <div class="c1">Procedure for Preparation</div>

                <p>1. Prepare accounts for adjustments to find hidden information.</p>
                <p>2. Observe balance sheets and accounts for adjustments. Adjust non-cash items, non-operating items,
                    and current assets & current liabilities to net profit except cash and bank balances.</p>
                <p>3. Observe all fixed assets and their adjustment accounts. Show purchase and sale of assets.</p>
                <p>4. Observe all capital & long-term liabilities and their adjustment accounts. Show capital & loans
                    received and repaid.</p>

                <div class="c1">Advantages Of Cash Flow Statement</div>

                <p>1. It shows the actual cash position available with the company between the two balance sheet dates,
                    which funds flow and profit and loss account are unable to show. So, it is important to make a cash
                    flow report if one wants to know about the liquidity position of the company.</p>
                <p>2. It helps the company in accurately projecting the future liquidity position of the company,
                    enabling it to arrange for any shortfall in money by arranging finance in advance. If there is
                    excess, it can help the company in earning extra returns by deploying excess funds.</p>
                <p>3. It acts like a filter and is used by many analysts and investors to judge whether the company has
                    prepared the financial statements properly or not. If there is any discrepancy in the cash position
                    as shown by the balance sheet and the cash flow statement, it means that statements are incorrect.
                </p>

                <div class="c1">Disadvantages Of Cash Flow Statement</div>

                <p>1. Since it shows only the cash position, it is not possible to deduce the actual profit and loss of
                    the company by just looking at this statement.</p>
                <p>2. In isolation, this is of no use and it requires other financial statements like balance sheet,
                    profit and loss, etc., and therefore limiting its use.</p>

                <div class="c1">Practice Problems And Solutions</div>

                <p>1. From the following balance sheets as on 31-12-2016 and 31-12-2017. You are required to prepare a
