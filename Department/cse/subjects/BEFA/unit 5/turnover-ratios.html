                <p>Activity ratios are classed as Turnover ratios. These ratios tell how active the firm is in selling
                    stocks, collecting money from debtors, and paying to creditors. They are given below.</p>

                <strong>1. Inventory Turnover Ratio:</strong>

                <p>It is also called Stock turnover ratio. It indicates the number of times the average stock is being
                    sold during a given accounting period. The higher the ratio, the better the performance of the firm
                    in selling its stock. It is the rate at which inventories are converted into sales and then to cash.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio =</strong><br>
                    <em>Cost of goods sold / Average Stock</em>
                </p>

                <p>Cost of goods sold = Opening stock + Purchases + Manufacturing expenses – Closing stock (or) = Sales
                    – Gross profit</p>

                <p><strong>Average stock =</strong><br>
                    <em>(Opening stock + Closing stock) / 2</em>
                </p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    1. When cost of goods sold is not given, sales amount should be taken into account.<br>
                    2. When opening stock is not given, closing stock is considered as ‘average stock’.</p>

                <p><strong>Example 1:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Inventory Holding Period =</strong><br>
                    <em>365 days / Inventory Turnover Ratio</em>
                </p>

                <p>A firm sold goods worth Rs. 500000 and its gross profit is 20% of the sales value. The inventory at
                    the beginning of the year was Rs. 16000 and at the end of the year was 14000. Compute inventory
                    turnover ratio and also the inventory holding period.</p>

                <p><strong>Inventory Turnover Ratio =</strong><br>
                    <em>Cost of goods sold / Average Stock</em>
                </p>

                <p>Cost of goods sold = Sales – Gross profit = 500000 – (500000 x 20%) = 400000</p>

                <p><strong>Average stock =</strong><br>
                    <em>(Opening stock + Closing stock) / 2</em><br>
                    = (16000 + 14000) / 2 = 15000
                </p>

                <p><strong>Inventory Holding Period =</strong><br>
                    <em>365 days / Inventory Turnover Ratio</em><br>
                    = 365 / 26.66 = 14 days
                </p>

                <strong>2. Debtors Turnover Ratio:</strong>

                <p>It reveals the number of times the average debtors are collected during a given accounting period.
                    The firms usually prepare the aged list of debtors showing the details of when to collect and how
                    much to collect from debtors. The higher the ratio, the better the performance of the firm in
                    collecting money from debtors.</p>

                <p><strong>Debtors Turnover Ratio =</strong><br>
                    <em>Net Credit Sales / Average Debtors</em>
                </p>

                <p>Net Credit Sales = Credit sales – Returns</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    1. When credit sales are not given, total sales are taken.<br>
                    2. If opening debtors are not given, closing debtors should be considered as average debtors.</p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Debt Collection Period =</strong><br>
                    <em>365 days / Debtors Turnover Ratio</em>
                </p>

                <p>A firm’s sales during the year were Rs. 400000 of which 60% were credit sales. The balance of debtors
                    at the beginning and end of the year was 25000 and 15000 respectively. Calculate debtors turnover
                    ratio of the firm. Also find out the debt collection period.</p>

                <p><strong>Debtors Turnover Ratio =</strong><br>
                    <em>Net Credit Sales / Average Debtors</em><br>
                    = 240000 / 20000 = 12 times
                </p>

                <p>Net Credit Sales = Sales x 60/100 = 400000 x 60/100 = 240000</p>

                <p><strong>Average debtors =</strong><br>
                    <em>(Opening debtors + Closing debtors) / 2</em><br>
                    = (25000 + 15000) / 2 = 20000
                </p>

                <p><strong>Debt Collection Period =</strong><br>
                    <em>365 days / Debtors Turnover Ratio</em><br>
                    = 365 / 12 = 30.41 days
                </p>

                <strong>3. Creditors Turnover Ratio:</strong>

                <p>It reveals the number of times the average creditors are paid during a given accounting period. The
                    firms usually prepare the aged list of creditors showing the details of when to pay and how much to
                    pay to its creditors. It shows how promptly the firm is in a position to pay its creditors.</p>

                <p><strong>Creditors Turnover Ratio =</strong><br>
                    <em>Net Credit Purchases / Average Creditors</em>
                </p>

                <p>Net Credit Purchases = Credit Purchases – Returns</p>

                <p><strong>Note:</strong>
                    1. When credit purchases are not given, total purchases are taken.<br>
                    2. If opening creditors are not given, closing creditors should be considered as average creditors.
                </p>

                <p><strong>Example:</strong></p>

                <p><strong>Creditors Payment Period =</strong><br>
                    <em>365 days / Creditors Turnover Ratio</em>
                </p>

                <p>A firm’s purchases during the year were Rs. 400000 of which 50% were credit purchases. The balance of
                    creditors at the beginning and end of the year was 30000 and 10000 respectively. Calculate creditors
                    turnover ratio of the firm. Also find out creditors payment period.</p>

                <p><strong>Creditors Turnover Ratio =</strong><br>
                    <em>Net Credit Purchases / Average Creditors</em><br>
                    = 200000 / 20000 = 10 times
                </p>

                <p>Net Credit Purchases = Purchases x 50/100 = 400000 x 50/100 = 200000</p>

                <p><strong>Average creditors =</strong><br>
                    <em>(Opening creditors + Closing creditors) / 2</em><br>
                    = (30000 + 10000) / 2 = 20000
                </p>

                <p><strong>Creditors Payment Period =</strong><br>
                    <em>365 days / Creditors Turnover Ratio</em><br>
                    = 365 / 10 = 36.5 days
                </p>
